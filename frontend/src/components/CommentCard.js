            Will you do the same for me? It's time to face the music I'm no
            longer your muse. Heard it's beautiful, be the judge and my girls
            gonna take a vote. I can feel a phoenix inside of me. Heaven is
            jealous of our love, angels are crying from up above. Yeah, you take
            me to utopia.
